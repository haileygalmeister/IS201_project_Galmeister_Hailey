        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>
            As an aspiring event planner, I am dedicated to designing
            exceptional experiences that enhance enjoyment and better the lives
            of others. With a passion for connecting with both individuals and
            groups, I strive to create events that make a lasting impact and
            leave a positive impression on all attendees.<br />
            I am excited to begin an internship in the near future at the St.
            Regis in Deer Valley, where I will further develop my skills in
            event planning and management.<br />
            I am a hardworking and dedicated individual who is committed to
            making a positive impact in the lives of others through
            well-organized events and experiences. I am open to any opportunity
            to help with events, and I am confident in my ability to contribute
            to any team.
